A slightly modified rail system to promote easier upgrades of large rail systems.

Assuming a progression of *Normal Rail* -> *Electric Rail* -> *Monorail* -> *Maglev*, an engine can now run (unpowered) on the generation of rail before it and run powered on its 'normail rail' and the next generation of rail.
