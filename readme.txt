About Progressive Rail Set
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
The **Progressive Rail Set** is a NewGRF that serves to make upgrading of
    larger, advanced rail systems easier. Assuming a progression of *Normal
    Rail* -> *Electric Rail* -> *Monorail* -> *Maglev* -> *Vacuum Tube*, an 
    engine can now run (unpowered) on the generation of rail before it and run 
    powered on its "normal rail" and the next generation of rail.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The **Progressive Rail Set** requires OpenTTD, which is a free download from
    <http://www.openttd.org/>. The Set has been tested on OpenTTD 1.2.3, but 
    will likely work on earlier versions.

If you want to use Vacuum Tube tracks, you'll use a separate NewGRF to provide
    them.

Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The easiest (and recommended) way to install the Set is use OpenTTD's 'Check
    Online Content' interface. Search for "Progressive Rail Set". This also 
    makes it very easy for me to provide updates.

Manual installation can be accomplished by putting the "progressive_rail_x.grf"
    file you downloaded in the  '..\OpenTTD\newgrf'  folder.

Once installed, the Set can be selected through 'NewGRF Settings' on OpenTTD's
    main interface.

Settings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no settings for the Set.

Version History
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1 [2012-11-03]
 * Initial implementation
 * Supports normal rails, electrified rails, monorail, maglev and vacuum tube

See the attached CHANGELOG.txt for full version history.

Roadmap
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At this time, I think the Set is feature complete, so I am not adding any
    additional features.

Known Issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Vacuum Tube tracks have to be supplied by a separate NewGRF
